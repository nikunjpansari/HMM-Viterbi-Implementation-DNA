# HMM Viterbi Implementation for DNA Sequence Computation

This repository contains an implementation of the Viterbi algorithm for DNA sequence computation in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The implementation is provided as a Jupyter Notebook.

## Usage

To use this implementation, you can open the Jupyter Notebook file [HMM_Viterbi_Implementation.ipynb](https://github.com/nikunjpansari/HMM-Viterbi-Implementation-DNA/blob/main/HMM_Viterbi_Implementation.ipynb) in this repository. The notebook contains all the code and explanations necessary to understand and run the HMM Viterbi algorithm for DNA sequence computation.

Alternatively, you can follow the steps below:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nikunjpansari/HMM-Viterbi-Implementation-DNA.git
cd HMM-Viterbi-Implementation-DNA
jupyter notebook HMM_Viterbi_Implementation.ipynb
