## HMM Viterbi Implementation for DNA Sequence Computation

This repository contains an implementation of the Viterbi algorithm for DNA sequence computation in a Hidden Markov Model (HMM).

## Introduction

The Viterbi algorithm is a dynamic programming algorithm used to find the most likely hidden state sequence given an observed sequence and an HMM model. In this implementation, the hidden states represent different nucleotides (A, C, G, T), and the observed sequence represents a given DNA sequence.

## Usage

To use this implementation, you can clone the repository and run the provided code. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nikunjpansari/HMM-Viterbi-Implementation-DNA.git
cd HMM-Viterbi-Implementation-DNA
Run [HMM_Viterbi_Implementation](https://github.com/nikunjpansari/HMM-Viterbi-Implementation-DNA/blob/main/HMM_Viterbi_Implementation.ipynb)
